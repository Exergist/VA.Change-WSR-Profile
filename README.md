# VA.Change-WSR-Profile
A general purpose profile for changing the active Windows Speech Recognition (WSR) profile with VoiceAttack (VA). 

The VoiceAttack (VA) profile "Change WSR Profile" (see "Change WSR Profile.vap") provides two VA commands: 
 - Change WSR profile by voice command
 - Change WSR profile based on variable
As you might guess the first command allows the user to change WSR profiles using a voice command, and the second command allows the user to change to a specific WSR profile based on the value stored in a text variable. 
 
 More information about the VoiceAttack voice control and macro creation software may be found at www.voiceattack.com.
